# whapped

A simple, yet addictive iOS application that allows the user to whip, lightsabe, punch, and slap 
those around them complete with satisfying sound effects and vibration upon "impact." 

Inspired by the dash of Indiana Jones and the mysterious power of Yoda from Star Wars, this application allows you, too, 
to defend the truth with power. 

Upon detecting rough motion, releases a sharp sound (whip, lightsaber, or other depending on mode) and vibrates.
Useful for duels.

Originally collab with Lisa Lee at HSHacks on an app inventor.
Later, converted to Swift, with storyboard mapping in XCode.
