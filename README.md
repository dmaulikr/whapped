# whapped

A simple, yet addictive iOS application that allows the user to whip, lightsabe, punch, and slap 
those around them complete with satisfying sound effects and vibration upon "impact." 

Inspired by the dash of Indiana Jones and the mysterious power of Yoda from Star Wars, this application allows you, too, 
to defend the truth with power. 

Upon detecting rough motion, releases a sharp sound (whip, lightsaber, or other depending on mode) and vibrates.
Useful for duels.

Idea originally from collab with Lisa Lee at HSHacks in 2014 on an app inventor.

Now, revived and rewritten together entirely in Swift/XCode! 

As always, in progress. Next steps involve more subtle motion detection, versatility mode.
Slap only on right to left motion. Punch only on forward motion. Etc.
